# Accelerators
Accelerators is a three-dimensional car racing game that can be played in real-time by multiple players connected through a LAN (Local Area Network) network. The game’s code scripts are written in C#, and it is developed in the Unity Engine. The game is implemented using the client-server architecture and uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) as its underlying transport layer protocol. The application achieves synchronization among the players in real-time using the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) concept of distributed systems. Apart from synchronization, the game delivers various features to the user such as keeping track of best lap time, user authentication, enhanced UI (User Interface), and Effective GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) utilization to complement the user’s gameplay.
